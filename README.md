## Mandelbrot Set

### Introduction

The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal in mathematics. It is defined by iterating a simple mathematical formula and examining the behavior of the resulting values. The set is named after BenoÃ®t B. Mandelbrot, who introduced the concept.

### Mathematics

The Mandelbrot set is defined by the iterative process:

\[ Z_{n+1} = Z_{n}^2 + C \]

Where:
- \(Z_{n}\) is a complex number representing the current iteration.
- \(C\) is a complex constant representing the initial value.
- The iteration continues until \(|Z_{n}| > 2\) or a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.

The set consists of all complex values of \(C\) for which the iteration does not diverge to infinity.

## Project Overview

This project leverages CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA, to perform high-performance parallel computations on the GPU. The Visual Studio 2019 solution includes CUDA kernels for computing the Mandelbrot set in parallel, allowing for real-time visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
